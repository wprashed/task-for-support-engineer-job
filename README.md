I am attempting to create a new user from the users page, using the username "Steven Paul Jobs", but encountering an issue. Please resolve the issue and create a new user with the specified username.

### Task One
Currently, there is no backend validation for the user's email field, allowing the creation of new users without a valid email address. It is necessary to implement backend validation for this field.
